# WolfPubDB_TeamG

## Project overview

We designed a database system for WolfPubDb for the wolfcity publishing house
which maintains information about the staff authors, editors, distributors, and different kinds of
publications. The system must be able to perform actions such as managing publications,
assigning editors, assigning authors, generating monthly reports which include payments made
towards editors and authors, revenue and expenses of the publishing house, and sales statistics of
each publication. The system also performs operations for distributors like adding and updating a
distributor, maintaining balances, taking orders of different publications, and billing them
accordingly.
The WolfPubDb deals with a large number of users involved in various activities that require
concurrent access to vast data. Since a database management system offers excellent benefits in
terms of efficient data storage, access, and retrieval, this can be considered as an effective
solution to address the above problem statement. The transaction manager in a DBMS will help
ensure that all the transactions that can occur in our publication house are atomic, consistent,
isolated, and durable. Having a database management system will help achieve these properties
conveniently over maintaining the records over a file system.
